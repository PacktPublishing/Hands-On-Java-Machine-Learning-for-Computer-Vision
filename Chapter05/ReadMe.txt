This application beside that is able to generate art offers quite an detailed view of how neural network
are learning and what are they learning
Is highly suggested to through go derivations there and back propagation steps

Although this code is especially optimized(3-4times faster than the contributed version to DL4J)
to use multi threading and high level or parallelism, it still takes a lot of time to have a good generate image
Approximately it takes 4-6 hours or even more on CPU and please be ready to increase the memory
