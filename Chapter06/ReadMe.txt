The implementation is based on https://github.com/iwantooxxoox/Keras-OpenFace

In this application we are using the weights from Keras saved into .csv files and than adapt into DL4J structure
In future further consolidation may needed in the way we load the weights so right now the model may
still need some tuning so please stay tuned as the code
it will continually improved to a state of the art accuracy

Please notice that the open face model is quite small comparing to real systems so the accuracy may not
be the best but it is quite promising and it clearly shows the power of the explored concept on videos
